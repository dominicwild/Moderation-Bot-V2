# IRC Bot
An IRC bot made from scratch using a TCP client to implement processing of IRC messages, using the RFC resources describing the protocol ([RFC1459](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459), [RFC2812](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2812) etc).

This could be expanded to be a full fledge independent IRC library, with a bot API written on top of it. There was no library like this I could find that satisfied by needs, so I started to implement my own.
